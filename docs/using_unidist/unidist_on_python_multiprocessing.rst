Unidist on Python Multiprocessing
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

This section describes the use of unidist with the Python Multiprocessing execution backend.

There are two ways to choose the execution backend to run on.
First, the recommended way is to use the argument of unidist CLI:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Running the script with unidist on Python Multiprocessing backend
    $ unidist script.py --backend multiprocessing

For more information on the CLI arguments specific to the Python Multiprocessing backend
see :doc:`unidist CLI </using_cli>` section.

Second, setting the environment variable:

.. code-block:: bash

    # unidist will use Python Multiprocessing backend to distribute computations
    export UNIDIST_BACKEND=multiprocessing

For more information on the environment variables and associated configs specific to the Python Multiprocessing backend
see :doc:`config API </flow/unidist/config>` section.

.. note::
   Note that the config ``Backend`` object associated with the ``UNIDIST_BACKEND`` environment variable
   doesn't make sense to use in your code to set the execution backend since the environment variable and
   the argument of unidist CLI supersede that value.
