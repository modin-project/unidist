Unidist Configuration Settings
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Using these configuration settings, the user can tune unidist's behavior. Below you can find
configuration settings currently provided by unidist.

Public API
''''''''''

Potentially, the source of configuration settings can be any, but for now only environment
variables are implemented. Any environment variable originates from
:class:`~unidist.config.parameter.EnvironmentVariable`, which contains most of
the config API implementation.

Usage Guide
'''''''''''

As it can be seen below a config value can be set either by setting the environment variable or
by using config API.

.. code-block:: python

    import os

    # Setting `UNIDIST_BACKEND` environment variable.
    # Also can be set outside the script.
    os.environ["UNIDIST_BACKEND"] = "mpi"

    import unidist.config as cfg

    # Checking initially set `Backend` config,
    # which corresponds to `UNIDIST_BACKEND` environment variable
    print(cfg.Backend.get()) # prints 'mpi'

    # Checking default value of `CpuCount`
    print(cfg.CpuCount.get()) # prints the number of CPUs on your machine

    # Changing value of `CpuCount`
    cfg.CpuCount.put(16)
    print(cfg.CpuCount.get()) # prints '16'

.. note::
   Make sure that setting configuration values happens before unidist initialization
   (:py:func:`~unidist.api.init` call)! Otherwise, unidist will opt for the default settings.

Note that unidist also supports its own command line interface (CLI) though which a config value can be set.
Wherein, strongly recommended do not mix setting a config value with multiple ways, use only one!

.. code-block:: bash

    # Running the script with unidist in a single node with `Backend` and
    # `CpuCount` config values set to `mpi` and `8`, respectively:
    $ unidist script.py --backend mpi --num_cpus 8

Refer to :doc:`full documentation </using_cli>` on how to run a python program with unidist using its CLI.
