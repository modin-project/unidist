Welcome to Unidist's documentation!
===================================

The framework is intended to provide the unified API for distributed execution
by supporting various distributed task schedulers. At the moment the following schedulers
are supported under the hood:

* `Ray`_
* `Dask Distributed`_
* `Python Multiprocessing`_
* `MPI`_

Also, the framework provides a sequential :doc:`Python backend <flow/unidist/core/backends/python/backend>`,
that can be used for debug purposes.

The unidist is designed to work in a `task-based parallel model`_.
