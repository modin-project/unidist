### What is unidist?

unidist is a framework that is intended to provide the unified API for distributed execution by supporting various performant execution backends and utilizing all of your CPUs cores. At the moment the following backends
are supported underneath the hood:

* [Ray](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/index.html)
* [MPI](https://www.mpi-forum.org/)
* [Dask Distributed](https://distributed.dask.org/en/latest/)
* [Python Multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html)

unidist is designed to work in a [task-based parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_parallelism) model.

Also, the framework provides a sequential ``Python`` backend, that can be used for debugging.

### Installation

Currently, unidist can be installed from sources using ``pip``:

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/modin-project/unidist
```

This will install unidist directly from the repo without you having to manually clone it! Please be aware that the latest changes have not made it into a release and may not be completely stable.

#### Choosing an execution backend

There are several ways to choose the execution backend for distributed computation.
First, the recommended way is to use
[unidist CLI](https://unidist.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using_cli.html) options:

```bash
# Running the script with unidist on Ray backend
$ unidist script.py --backend ray
# Running the script with unidist on Dask backend
$ unidist script.py --backend dask
```

Second, setting the environment variable:

```bash
# unidist will use Ray backend to distribute computations
export UNIDIST_BACKEND=ray
# unidist will use Dask backend to distribute computations
export UNIDIST_BACKEND=dask
```

Third, using [config API](https://unidist.readthedocs.io/en/latest/flow/unidist/config.html) directly in your script:

```python
import unidist.config as cfg
cfg.Backend.put("ray") # unidist will use Ray backend to distribute computations
import unidist.config as cfg
cfg.Backend.put("dask") # unidist will use Dask backend to distribute computations
```

Default execution backend for unidist is Ray.

#### Usage

unidist provides [CLI interface](https://unidist.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using_cli.html) to run python programs.

```python
import unidist
unidist.init() # Ray backend is used by default

@unidist.remote
def foo(x):
    return x * x

# This will run `foo` in parallel in workers;
# `refs` will contain object references to actual data
refs = [foo.remote(i) for i in range(5)]
# To get the data call `unidist.get(...)`
print(unidist.get(refs))
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
```
